            Painting Placer requires the webxr api which is a pretty new technology, only supported by latest mobile devices and latest browser versions. 
            If your device comply with the requirements and the website is completly loaded, there should appear a button to start the application.

            unfortunately usual iPhone and iPad browser did not implement the webxr standard yet.
            Since so, we suggest to use the WevXR Viewer browser by Mozilla. 
            You can <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056">download it from you App Store</a>
